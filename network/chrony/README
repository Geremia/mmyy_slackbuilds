Chrony is a pair of programs which are used to maintain the accuracy
of the real time clock on a computer via the NTP protocol.

Chrony can serve as both an NTP client for a single computer and as an NTP
server for other computers.

See http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/ for more details.

Note: Because each installation's configuration will differ, the SlackBuild
script does not build or install configuration files.  See the man pages for
chronyd and chrony.conf (and the contrib and examples directories) for
relevant configuration information.
