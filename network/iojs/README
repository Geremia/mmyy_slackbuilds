iojs (Evented I/O for V8 JavaScript)

io.js is a JavaScript platform built on Chrome's V8 runtime. This
project began as a fork of Joyent's Node.js(tm) and is compatible with
the npm ecosystem.

WARNING: iojs will conflict with nodejs.

Either install the nodejs package (recommended), or iojs from SBo, but
not both. All packages include npm. nodejs is the most current package.
