The OpenVPN Auth-LDAP Plugin implements username/password authentication
via LDAP for OpenVPN 2.x.

Features
  * User authentication against LDAP
  * Simple Apache-style configuration file
  * LDAP group-based access restrictions
  * Integration with the OpenBSD packet filter, support adding and removing
    VPN clients from PF tables based on group membership
  * Tested against OpenLDAP, the plugin will authenticate any LDAP server
    that supports LDAP simple binds -- including Active Directory.

Building the package
  When building this package you will need the source for the OpenVPN
  release that is installed on your VPN server.
  For Slackware 13.1 this is openvpn-2.1.1, as specified in the .info
  file.
  This is so openvpn-auth-ldap can build against the OpenVPN plugin header
  files for your particular version of OpenVPN.
