This software allows you to create and maintain an IPv6 tunnel if you don't
have native IPv6 connectivity.

If you wish to maintain a static IPv6 address, you *must* register a Freenet6
account and edit /etc/gogoc.conf with the account you configured.

Information on the Freenet6 tunnelbroker and a link to the registration process
is at http://gogonet.gogo6.com/page/freenet6-tunnelbroker
