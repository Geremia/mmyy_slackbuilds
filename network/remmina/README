Remmina is a remote desktop client written in GTK+, aiming to be 
useful for system administrators and travellers, who need to work 
with lots of remote computers in front of either large monitors or 
tiny netbooks. Remmina supports multiple network protocols in an 
integrated and consistant user interface. Currently RDP, VNC, NX, 
XDMCP and SSH are supported.

Optionally Avahi/Zeroconf (requires the optional dependency avahi)
support and Telepathy can be used as well, as long one passes
AVAHI=ON and/or TELEPATHY=ON to the script.
