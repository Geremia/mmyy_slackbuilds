PaleMoon (Web browser)

Pale Moon is an Open Source, Goanna-based web browser available for
Microsoft Windows and Linux (with other operating systems in development),
focusing on efficiency and ease of use. Make sure to get the most out
of your browser!

Pale Moon offers you a browsing experience in a browser completely
built from its own, independently developed source that has been forked
off from Firefox/Mozilla code, with carefully selected features and
optimizations to improve the browser's speed*, resource use, stability
and user experience, while offering full customization and a growing
collection of extensions and themes to make the browser truly your own.

This SlackBuild may conflict with a SlackBuild known, here at SBo, as
"palemoon"; which repackages binaries offically released by the Pale Moon
devs. This SlackBuild attempts to, compile, build, and package, Pale Moon,
Slackware style, in a manner that conforms to official Pale Moon Linux
releases; while, at the same time, providing useful and easy ways to deviate
if desired.

See http://docs.slackware.com/howtos:software:palemoon for additional
tips and help resources.

Using the Oxygen theme is known to cause Pale Moon to crash; if you are
experiencing crashes, and segfaults, make sure you are not using this theme.
See the help doc link above for creative tips and workarounds.

It is important that the dependency gst-libav is present while Pale Moon is
being compiled, or else Pale Moon will lack the ability to play h.264 html 5
video; installing it after the fact will not resolve this issue.

A native fork of FireFox's developer tools exists as an external add-on or
internally. Pale Moon by default ships with the developer tools internally;
if desired, do DEVTOOLS=no ./PaleMoon.SlackBuild to build Pale Moon without
them.

Pale Moon's default is to build, ship, and use its own internal dictionary;
if desired, however, do USE_SYSTEM_HUNSPELL=yes ./PaleMoon.SlackBuild, to
use the Slackware system Hunspell instead.

If your processor doesn't support sse2 instructions or you get segfaults,
try looking in the SlackBuild for the OPTIMIZE build option (eventually
refer to the Pale Moon developers for help).

To enable debug information, pass the script the parameter
ENABLE_DEBUG=yes
