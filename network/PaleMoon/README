PaleMoon (Web browser)

Pale Moon is an Open Source, Goanna-based web browser available for
Microsoft Windows and Linux (with other operating systems in development),
focusing on efficiency and ease of use. Make sure to get the most out
of your browser!

Pale Moon offers you a browsing experience in a browser completely
built from its own, independently developed source that has been forked
off from Firefox/Mozilla code, with carefully selected features and
optimizations to improve the browser's speed*, resource use, stability
and user experience, while offering full customization and a growing
collection of extensions and themes to make the browser truly your own.

If your processor doesn't support sse2 instructions or you get segfaults
try looking in the SlackBuild for the OPTIMIZE build option (eventually
refer to the palemoon developers for help).

To enable debug information, pass the script the parameter
ENABLE_DEBUG=yes
