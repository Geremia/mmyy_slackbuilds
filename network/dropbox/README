Version 3.0.x is using local QT libraries for the UI.
The current version still does not show the tray icons well or at all.
Usually turning off composition will enable the tray icons.
The synchronization engine is not effected by is and even if there are
no tray icons the synchronization works.

See the SlackBuild file for a more detailed log.
