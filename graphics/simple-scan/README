simple-scan is a simple scanning utility designed to be less
overwhelming than xsane for casual/occasional scanning jobs.

colord and packagekit are optional dependencies and can be
turned on by invoking the script as follows:

colord=yes ./simple-scan.SlackBuild OR
packagekit=yes ./simple-scan.SlackBuild OR
colord=yes packagekit=yes ./simple-scan.SlackBuild
