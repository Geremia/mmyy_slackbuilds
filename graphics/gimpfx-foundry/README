gimpfx-foundry is a repository for porting and creating GPL licensed
scripts for the latest GIMP. At the moment that is 2.6. In the future
this effort can be directed towards newer versions easily while still
providing a source for older versions of scripts.

After installing the scripts, open GIMP 2.6, click on Filter > Script-Fu
> Refresh Scripts. A new FX-Foundry menu will appear alongside the
default menus.
