Frescobaldi is a LilyPond sheet music text editor for KDE4. It aims to be
powerful, yet lightweight and easy to use.

Optional runtime dependencies are rumor, to insert notes via midi (ex.
keyboard), and TiMidity++ for midi playback (you will need to configure
both TiMidity++ and some other midi playback program like audacious).
