MySQL-python (Python interface to MySQL)

MySQLdb is an interface to the popular MySQL database server for Python.
The design goals are:

    * Compliance with Python database API version 2.0 [PEP-0249]
    * Thread-safety
    * Thread-friendliness (threads will not block each other)

MySQL-3.23 through 5.1 and Python-2.3 through 2.6 are currently supported.
