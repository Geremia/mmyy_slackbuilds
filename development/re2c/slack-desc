# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

re2c: re2c (regular expressions to C/C++ conversion tool)
re2c:
re2c: It is a tool for writing very fast and very flexible scanners. Unlike
re2c: any other such tool, re2c focuses on generating high efficient code for
re2c: regular expression matching. As a result this allows a much broader
re2c: range of use than any traditional lexer offers. And last but not least
re2c: re2c generates warning free code that is equal to hand-written code in
re2c: terms of size, speed and quality.
