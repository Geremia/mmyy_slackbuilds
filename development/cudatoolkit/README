CUDA Toolkit CUDA is NVIDIA's parallel computing architecture. It
enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the
power of the GPU.

NOTE:
- the binary file to download is 1,4 Gb;
- the temporary package file will need 3,5 Gb;
- the final package will be around 1 Gb (2,2 Gb when installed).
Be sure to have enough free space before building this.

this cuda version requires a patch in the package glibc-2.29
