libbluray is an open-source library designed for Blu-Ray Discs playback for
media players, like VLC or MPlayer.  libbluray integrates navigation, playlist
parsing, menus and BD-J.  libbluray is DRM-circumvention free, and thus, safe to
integrate in your software.

Optional dependencies are libaacs and apache-ant (it can make use of java
-aka bdjava- installing it and and then running the script with the extra
parameter BDJAVA=yes sh libbluray.SlackBuild).

Most commercial Blu-Ray are protected by AACS or BD+ technologies and this
library is not enough to playback those discs.
