OpenSubdiv is a set of open source libraries that implement high performance
subdivision surface (subdiv) evaluation on massively parallel CPU and GPU
architectures. This codepath is optimized for drawing deforming subdivs with
static topology at interactive framerates. The resulting limit surface matches
Pixar's Renderman to numerical precision.

This package need this manual patch to compile in file /usr/include/bits/floatn.h!
