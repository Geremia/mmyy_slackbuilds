Intel(r) Threading Building Blocks (Intel TBB) offers a rich and complete
approach to expressing parallelism in a C++ program. It is a library that
helps you take advantage of multi-core processor performance without having
to be a threading expert. Intel TBB is not just a threads-replacement library.
It represents a higher-level, task-based parallelism that abstracts platform
details and threading mechanisms for scalability and performance.

we need to compile with GCC 6.3.x to use in OpenSubDiv avoiding error 
../libtbb.so.2: undefined reference to `std::__exception_ptr::exception_ptr::exception_ptr(void*)@CXXABI_1.3.11'
../libtbb.so.2: undefined reference to `__cxa_init_primary_exception@CXXABI_1.3.11'
