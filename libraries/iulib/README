Iulib is a library of image understanding-related algorithms.  It provides 
basic image processing, mathematical morphology, and machine learning 
algorithms.  Iulib implements easy-to-use image and video I/O functions, as 
well as a large number of common image processing functions.

Design goals are high portability, easy-to-understand algorithms, no reliance 
on STL, and using a minimal set of data structures.
