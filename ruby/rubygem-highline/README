HighLine is a Ruby Gem designed to ease the tasks of doing console
input and output with low-level methods like gets() and puts().
HighLine provides a robust system for requesting data from a user,
without needing to code all the error checking and validation rules and
without needing to convert the typed Strings into what your program
really needs.  Just tell HighLine what you're after, and let it do
all the work.
