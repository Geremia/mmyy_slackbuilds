UrbanTerror is an urban combat themed First Person Shooter.
Urban Terror started as a realism based "total conversion" mod for 
Quake III Arena. Nowadays, Urban Terror is played using the free, 
stand-alone, ioquake3 engine modified, which doesn't require 
Quake III Arena, in addition to being an add-on to id Software's.

UPDATING SLACKWARE 12.2 TO 13.0
If you had a previous installation under Slackware 12.2 and are using the 
same user profile, you will not be able to download maps from servers.
You will receive a message about the game not finding libcurl.so.3.
This message is received because Slackware 13.0 is using libcurl.so.4, 
the solution to this issue is to run the following command in the terminal:
sed -i 's/libcurl.so.3/libcurl.so.4/g' $HOME/.q3a/q3ut4/q3config.cfg

This command will replace the reference in your game confguration file
with a reference to the newer libraries.

Any new profiles will automatically have the correct reference because the
primary configuration has already been altered.
