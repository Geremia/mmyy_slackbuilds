This project aims to ease the usage of legacy, non JACK enabled
applications, in a JACK MIDI enabled system, when using jack2.

Typical usecase is e.g. to connect bristol/azr3 with qtractor/seq24.

Note: The latest jack-audio-connection-kit release contains a2jmidid
functionality by itself.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
