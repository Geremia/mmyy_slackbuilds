freepats is a free and open set of instrument patches.  A patchset is
required for MIDI files to be audible through TiMidity++.  These patches
also work with applications that use SDL_mixer for MIDI audio.

To use freepats with TiMidity++ and/or SDL_mixer, edit /etc/timidity.cfg 
and make it look like this:
	source /etc/timidity/freepats.cfg

Alternatively, use crude.cfg instead of freepats.cfg to use substitute
patches that fill in missing entries in the tone bank.
