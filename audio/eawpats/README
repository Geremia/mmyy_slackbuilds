eawpats is a sound patches library for TiMidity++.  This package contains
a patchset for the TiMidity++ MIDI player.  A patchset is required for
MIDI files to be audible through TiMidity++.  These patches also work
with applications that use SDL_mixer for MIDI audio.

Note that eawpats contains proprietary sound samples.  According to the
ALSA Wiki:

"Half of the patches in eawpats are derived from original Gravis patches,
and therefore may have some intellectual property issues."

If this is a concern to you, use freepats instead (however, eawpats does
sound nicer).  For more information, see /usr/doc/eawpats-12/copyrigh.txt

To use eawpats with TiMidity++ and/or SDL_mixer, edit /etc/timidity.cfg 
and make it look like this:
	source /etc/timidity/eawpats.cfg
