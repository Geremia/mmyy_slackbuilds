Snd is a sound editor modelled loosely after Emacs.  It is highly
programmable, supports a variety of audio and sample file formats,
includes a complete implementation of Common Lisp Music (CLM), and
can be run sans GUI as a scripting engine.

This script build against the Motif toolkit primarily because
Snd's GTK+ interface doesn't seem as well-tested (tending to crash
unexpectedly on this maintainer's x86_64 machines), but also because
it supports OpenGL rendering of spectrograms.

Comment out the "--with-gl" line in snd.SlackBuild if you don't want this.
