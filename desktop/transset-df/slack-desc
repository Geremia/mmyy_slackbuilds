# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

transset-df: This is a patched version of xorg's transset. Several different
transset-df: 'select methods' are added: 'select by pointing' which lets the
transset-df: user run transset directly on the window currently under the
transset-df: cursor without having to click and 'select by name or id'.
