transset-df

This is a patched version of xorg's transset I wanted to integrate
transset into my windowmanager and to be able to set and unset
transparency by just pressing a key.  To make that possible I added
several different 'select methods'.  The first one was 'select by
pointing' which lets the user run transset directly on the window
currently under the cursor without having to click. Later select by name
and id was added after inspiration from other transset patches.

In the future I guess it's meant for the windowmanagers to handle
transparency. Then we will hopefully see these functions and many
other now imposible function. This will however require you to wait
untill this is implemented in your favorite wm. This patch is a way of
"scratching where it itches", by creating a usefull integration with every
windowmanager without changing any wm-code. The "unix way" of doing it :)
