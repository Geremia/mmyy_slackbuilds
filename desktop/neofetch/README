neofetch is a script that gathers information about your system and
prints it to the terminal next to an image, a distro's logo or any ASCII
art of your choice.

Optional dependencies:

- Desktop Environment and Window Manager: xprop
- Displaying images: w3m-img [1] [2]
- Thumbnail creation: imagemagick
- Displaying song information from Google Play Music Desktop Player:
- gpmdp-remote (https://github.com/iAndrewT/gpmdp-remote)

- Wallpaper: feh, nitrogen or gsettings (just choose one)
- Current Song: mpc, cmus, moc, spotify, deadbeef, rhythmbox, banshee,
                amarok, gpmdc [3]
- Resolution: xorg-xrandr or xorg-xdpyinfo [4]
- Screenshot: scrot [5]


[1] w3m-img is sometimes bundled together with w3m.

[2] Image support only works in certain terminal emulators. The script
    will fallback to ascii mode on terminal emulators that don't support
    the xterm escape sequences we're using for image sizing.

[3] Although you can choose more than one music player, the neofetch will
    gather info from the only music player that is running (except if mpc
    is installed, neofetch will gather it from mpc instead)

[4] Xrandr is prefered over xdpyinfo as Xrandr supports multi monitor
    and refresh rate display in the output.

[5] You can use the launch flag `--scrot_cmd` or change the config
    option '$scrot_cmd' to your screenshot program's cmd and neofetch
    will use it instead of scrot.
