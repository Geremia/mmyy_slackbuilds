neofetch is a script that gathers information about your system and
prints it to the terminal next to an image, a distro's logo or any ASCII
art of your choice.

Image mode dependencies:
These dependencies are required for image mode to work.

- Displaying images: w3m-img [1] or Terminology [2]
- Thumbnail creation: imagemagick
- Window size: A terminal emulator that supports \033[14t or xdotool
               xwininfo + xprop or xwininfo + xdpyinfo

[1] w3m-img is sometimes bundled together with w3m.
[2] Image support is built into Terminology so w3m-img isn't needed.

Other optional dependencies:
- Song:
  - Google Play Music Desktop Player (gdmdp-remote)
  - MPD (through mpc)
  - moc
  - Spotify
  - Rhythmbox
  - Banshee
  - Amarok
  - Deadbeef

  NOTE: You can have two or more music players installed, and neofetch
        will only detect the music playing through the only music player
        that is running.

- Detecting DE and WM: xprop
- Resolution: xrandr or xdpyinfo
  NOTE: Xrandr is prefered over xdpyinfo as Xrandr supports multi
        monitor and refresh rate display in the output.
- Wallpaper: feh, gsettings, or nitrogen
- Screenshot: scrot
  NOTE: You can use the launch flag --scrot_cmd or change the config
        option $scrot_cmd to your screenshot program's command, and
        neofetch will use it instead of scrot.
