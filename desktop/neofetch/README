neofetch is a script that gathers information about your system and
prints it to the terminal next to an image, a distro's logo or any ASCII
art of your choice.

Optional dependencies

Image mode:
  w3m or terminology

Song:
  mpc and mpd
  spotify
  rhythmbox
  deadbeef
  pragha

  NOTE: You can have two or more music players installed, and neofetch
        will only detect music playing through the music player that
        is running.

Wallpaper:
  feh or nitrogen

Screenshot:
  scrot

  NOTE: You can use the launch flag --scrot_cmd or change the config
        option $scrot_cmd to your screenshot program's command, and
        neofetch will use it instead of scrot.
