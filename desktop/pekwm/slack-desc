pekwm: Lightweight window manager for X
pekwm: 
pekwm: pekwm is a window manager that once up on a time was based 
pekwm: on the aewm++ window manager, but it has evolved enough that it 
pekwm: no longer resembles aewm++ at all. It has a much expanded 
pekwm: feature-set, including window grouping (similar to ion, pwm, 
pekwm: or fluxbox), autoproperties, xinerama, keygrabber that supports 
pekwm: keychains, and much more.
