Synergy+ (synergy-plus) lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard
between multiple computers with different operating systems, without
special hardware. All you need is a LAN connection. It's intended
for users with multiple computers, where each system uses its own
display. It's a little like having a 2nd or a 3rd desktop.

This build can co-exist with an existing synergy installation if
SYNERGYOLD is set to yes. This is set to no by default as synergy has
not been updated in some three years.

If SYNERGYOLD is set to yes, the two binaries synergyc (client)
and synergys (server) are suffixed with -plus to synergyc-plus and
synergys-plus.

The configuration file is /etc/synergy.conf. You will need to edit this
to suit your needs before synergy will work at all with the rc.synergys
script. Alternatively, you can choose to run synergys as a normal user, 
making your configuration file $HOME/.synergy.conf.
