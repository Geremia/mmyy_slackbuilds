TEMPer Temperature Sensor Linux Driver

TEMPer USB Thermometer interface driver and utility. 

The temper binary outputs temperatures as measured by the USB thermometer.

The code has been patched to work with the newest versions of the USB stick 
with code corrections from the comments section of the homepage. Also 
implemented changes for greater ease of parsing with standard tools (awk 
etc.).
