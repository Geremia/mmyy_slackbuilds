This PHP extension allows for the retrieval of information regarding 
a vast majority of files.

This information may include dimensions, quality, length, etc.,

Additionally it can also be used to retrieve the mime type for a
particular file and for text files proper language encoding.

This package is deprecated but I do need it for an AvantFAX web
application install I'm putting together.  The PECL install for this
particular extension doesn't work correctly so I've put together this
SlackBuild script and am sharing it with the community.
