WhatPulse is an application which monitors the number of keystrokes
and mouse clicks/movement. All of a user's keystrokes and mouse
statistics are pulsed and compiled into a nice view on whatpulse.org.

You will need to create a "whatpulse" group before building this, and
users will need to be in that group in order to use WhatPulse.
