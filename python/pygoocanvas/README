pygoocanvas (python bindings for GooCanvas)

GooCanvas is a new canvas widget for GTK+ that uses the cairo 2D library
for drawing. It has a model/view split, and uses interfaces for canvas
items and views, so you can easily turn any application object into
canvas items.

This package contains Python bindings for GooCanvas.
