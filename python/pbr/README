pbr (manage setuptools packaging)

A library for managing setuptools packaging in a consistent manner.

PBR is a library that injects some useful and sensible default behaviors
into your setuptools run.

PBR reads and then filters the setup.cfg data through a setup hook to
fill in default values and provide more sensible behaviors, and then
feeds the results in as the arguments to a call to setup.py

PBR is only mildly configurable. The basic idea is that there's a decent
way to run things and if you do, you should reap the rewards, because
then it's simple and repeatable. If you want to do things differently,
cool! But you've already got the power of python at your fingertips,
so you don't really need PBR.
