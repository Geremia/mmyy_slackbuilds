Mozilla Sunbird is a cross-platform calendar application built on the Mozilla 
Toolkit.  Our goal is to provide you with a full-featured and easy to use 
calendar application that you can use around the world.

Note: this is not available for x86_64 unless you do a source build, and
that appears to be non-trivial, so good luck if you decide to pursue it :)
