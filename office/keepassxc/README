KeePassXC is a password and personal data management application that supports
the KeePass Password Safe file format.

KeePassXC is a fork of KeePassX that aims to incorporate stalled Pull Requests,
features, and bug fixes that are not being incorporated into the main KeePassX
baseline. KeePassXC may be installed alongside KeePassX (also available as a
SlackBuild).

KeePassXC can be built with keepasshttp support, meaning that it can function
as password storage for Mozilla Firefox and Chromium. This may be enabled by
passing XC_HTTP=ON to the script.

Autotype may be disabled by passing XC_AUTOTYPE=OFF.
