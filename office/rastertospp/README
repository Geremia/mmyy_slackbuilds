SPP-2020 is a cheap photo printer from Samsung. The print quality is
great and usage costs are acceptable. However the manufacturer doesn't
provide a Linux driver which is somewhat strange for Samsung.

The rastertospp is a CUPS raster converter that takes a cups-raster as
its input, and on the output spits a stream of data suitable for direct
sending to the printer. This is one possible form of a driver for CUPS,
the one which makes most sense in the case of this printer.

Print quality of this driver seems the same as from the Windows driver,
no color profiling is done. As of version 1.1 there is an "Avoid
clipping" option (default: on) which in some cases yields better results
than stock Windows driver.

Data format suitable for the printer was derived by analysing several
print-to-files made on Windows.

Only best-quality on 4x6" (~10-15cm) photo paper is implemented but it
seems the only use-case anyway.

NOTE: The ppd file required for this printer is located in
/usr/share/cups/model/Samsung. It's called Samsung_SPP-2020.ppd.
