qemu (open source processor emulator)                                     

QEMU is a generic and open source processor emulator which achieves
a good emulation speed by using dynamic translation.               

This SlackBuild builds qemu-0.11.1 which was the last version to
support the kqemu kernel module (also available here). It is for
people with hardware that doesn't support virtualisation.
