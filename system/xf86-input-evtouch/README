xf86-input-evtouch (X.org touchscreen driver) 

This X.Org driver provides support for touchscreen input devices.
The driver is actually a evdev driver which supports events for moving in
absolute coordinates, relative coordinates and events for mouse buttons.

The latest version by the original author doesn't build against
xorg-server > 1.4, which was shipped with Slackware 12.2, so this SlackBuild
uses patches that hopefully make it work with later Slackware releases.

See README.SLACKWARE for configuration information.
