irqbalance is a Linux daemon that distributes interrupts over the 
processors and cores you have in your computer system.  The design goal 
of irqbalance is to do find a balance between power savings and optimal 
performance.  To a large degree, the work irqbalance does is invisible 
to you; if irqbalance performs its job correctly, nobody will ever notice 
it's there or want to turn it off.
