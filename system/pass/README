pass is a very simple password store that keeps passwords inside gpg2
encrypted files inside a simple directory tree residing at
~/.password-store.

The pass utility provides a series of commands for manipulating the password
store, allowing the user to add, remove, edit, synchronize, generate, and
manipulate passwords.

This script also include user-contributed scripts to help on migrating from
third-party applications.

Note:
Optional dependency: dmenu (passmenu support)
