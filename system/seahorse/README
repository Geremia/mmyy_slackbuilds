Seahorse is a GNOME application for managing encryption keys. It also
integrates with nautilus, gedit and other places for encryption 
operations.

This is the GTK+2 version of Seahorse.  Scrollkeeper support is
disabled as Rarian is the replacement for Scrollkeeper and Rarian
is not supported by this version of Seahorse.
