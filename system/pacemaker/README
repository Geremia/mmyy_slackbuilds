pacemaker (a scalable High-Availability cluster resource manager)

Pacemaker achieves maximum availability for your cluster services
by detecting and recovering from node and service-level failures. It
achieves this by utilizing the messaging and membership capabilities
provided by your preferred cluster infrastructure (currently either
OpenAIS or Heartbeat), If the startup and shutdown of your service
can scripted, Pacemaker can improve it's availability. Pacemaker
can manage clusters of practically any size and comes with a powerful
dependency model for accurately modeling your environment.

Thanks to the decision of the developers to completely bypass
the standards most other projects conform to:
   * The SlackBuild script contains hard-coding.
   * The build depends on autoconf, automake and libtool.
   * The build will produce soft-errors relating to mercurial,
     with invalid single-operand basename and dirname calls.

This SlackBuild is configured to use libesmtp. If you don't want
esmtp support you should change the "--with-esmtp \" line in the
script to "--without-esmtp \".
