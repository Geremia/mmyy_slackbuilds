The BitBabbler is a hardware True Random Number Generator (TRNG)
manufactured by Voicetronix of Australia.  This package installs the
software necessary to control and perform basic health checks on both
"white" or "black" varieties of BB devices.  After installing this
package:

1. Add group "bit-babbler", or modify
/etc/udev/rules.d/90-bit-babbler.rules to use an existing group (e.g.,
"wheel" or "adm").  Beside root, only members of this designated group
will be able to directly access BB devices on your system.

2a. Typically, you'll probably want your BitBabbler device(s) to start
feeding entropy to the kernel at boot.  Include these lines in
/etc/rc.d/rc.local:

# Start BitBabbler TRNG.
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.seedd ]; then
   . /etc/rc.d/rc.seedd start
fi

2b. It is also a good idea to stop your BB device from feeding entropy
to the kernel before capturing the random number seed on
shutdown/reboot.  Put these lines in /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown,
which you'll need to create if it doesn't already exist:

# Stop BitBabbler TRNG.
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.seedd ]; then
   . /etc/rc.d/rc.seedd stop
fi

Enjoy!
