This is a set of artwiz fonts that is compatible with fontconfig/Xft-2.0.

There are tarballs for several different languages (encodings?) available from
the artwiz-aleczapka website.  Take a look at the $FONTLANG variable in the
SlackBuild when building a non-English package.  All languages should be able
to coexist on the same machine.  The artwiz cursors are available in the
English tarball.

After installation you will need to restart X for the changes to take effect.

After uninstallation you may need to run "mkfontscale" and "mkfontdir" in
/usr/share/fonts/misc so that X can find the appropriate cursor font the
next time it starts.
