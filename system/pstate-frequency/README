pstate-frequency is able to adjust the Intel p-state driver 
values for the minimum and maximum scaling frequencies and 
the state of turbo boost.

You can enable optional feature by passing variables to
the script (ie. VAR=yes/no ./pstate-frequency.SlackBuild) :

WITH_UDEV_RULE=yes|no (default:no)
  Installs an udev rule for automatic frequency setting
  when the power source thas changed.
  
WITH_COMPLETION=yes|no (default:no)
  Installs bash & zsh completion.

Optional Dependencies : 

  * x86_energy_perf_policy
      This is used to set the CPU to normal performance 
      policy upon suspend and resume. It is used to 
      currently work around an assumed bug whereby on 
      resume the system is set to performance policy on 
      one core. It can help fix issues where upon resume 
      of the system, the CPU runs at frequencies higher 
      than that which is advertised to be available.
