Glances is a free (LGPL) cross-platform curses-based monitoring tool,
which aims to present a maximum of information in a minimum of space
and ideally fits in a classical 80x24 terminal, or larger for additional
information.

Glances can adapt dynamically the displayed information depending on
the terminal size. It can also work in a client/server mode for remote
monitoring.

This tool is written in Python and uses the psutil library to fetch the
statistical values from key elements, like CPU, load average, memory,
network, disks, file systems, processes, etc.

Optional dependencies are hddtemp (HHD temperature monitoring support),
pysnmp (SNMP support), matplotlib, netifaces and python3. Others not
available on SBo are bottle (Web server mode), py3sensors (HW monitoring
support), batinfo (battery monitoring support) and zeroconf.

NOTE: when launching Glances in a terminal with a bright background, the
option '--theme-white' is recommended.
