fzf - A command-line fuzzy finder written in Go

If you'd like to build with the tcell support (24bit colour support),
default no:

WITH_TCELL=yes ./fzf.SlackBuild

Please note the caveats mentioned here:
https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/BUILD.md#with-tcell

Vim Users: A fzf.vim plugin is installed to
/usr/share/vim/vimfiles/plugin. If you'd rather exclude the plugin,
or only manually enable it in your vim, you can build with:

WITH_VIM=no ./fzf.SlackBuild

and the plugin will be installed to /usr/share/fzf/vim/ instead.

NOTE: google-go-lang is only needed at compile time - not at runtime.
