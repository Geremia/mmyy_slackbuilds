openais (OSI Certified impl of Application Interface Specification)

The OpenAIS Standards Based Cluster Framework is an OSI Certified
implementation of the Service Availability Forum Application
Interface Specification (AIS).  The Application Interface
Specification is a software API and policies which are used to
develop applications that maintain service during faults. Restarting
and failover of applications is also provided for those deploying
applications which may not be modified.

The OpenAIS software is built to operate on the Corosync Cluster
Engine (http://www.corosync.org)  which allows any third party to
implement plugin cluster services using the infrastructure provided.
