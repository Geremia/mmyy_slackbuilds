DUMP (dump and restore backup commands)

Dump examines files in a filesystem, determines which ones need to be backed 
up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other storage medium. 
Subsequent incremental backups can then be layered on top of the full backup.

The restore command performs the inverse function of dump; it can restore a 
full backup of a filesystem. Single files and directory subtrees may also be 
restored from full or partial backups in interactive mode.

Slackware's tar package already has rmt, therefore this SlackBuild 
excludes it.

CONFLICT: The restore application conflicts with the tar package.

On installing this dump package "/usr/sbin/restore" will be overwritten.

Should you remove the dump package, you may note that this file will not be 
deleted because it is "shared" with the tar package. You may opt to reinstall 
the stock tar package after uninstalling the dump package.
Hint: # slackpkg reinstall tar

This SlackBuild disables the SELinux functionality and dependency.
