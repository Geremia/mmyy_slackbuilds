Rmw is a program written in C, designed to help manage your files and
prevent accidents at the command line. Rmw can send files to your "Desktop"
trash, or a completely separate folder. It can also: restore files; permanently
delete files that were rmw'ed more than xx number of days ago; skip files or
directories that have a "PROTECT" directive in the configuration file; and
append a unique string to the filenames so they won't get overwritten
(duplication protection).
