Afuse is an automounting file system implemented in user-space using
FUSE. Afuse currently implements the most basic functionality that can
be expected by an automounter; that is it manages a directory of virtual
directories. If one of these virtual directories is accessed and is not
already automounted, afuse will attempt to mount a filesystem onto that
directory. If the mount succeeds the requested access proceeds as normal,
otherwise it will fail with an error.
