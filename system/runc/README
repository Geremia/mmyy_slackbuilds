runC is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCP
specification. The code can be found on Github.

Embeddable

Containers are started as a child process of runC and can be embedded into
various other systems without having to run a Docker daemon.

Battle Hardened

runC is built on libcontainer, the same container technology powering millions
of Docker Engine installations.

Compatible with Docker

Docker images can be run with runC.
