Fakeroot makes it possible to run commands in an environment faking
root privileges. This is done by setting LD_PRELOAD to libfakeroot.so,
which provides wrappers around getuid, chown, chmod, mknod, stat, and
so on, thereby creating a fake root environment.

By passing MANPO=no to the SlackBuild, you can skip installing of
non-English man pages. If so, po4a is not required to build the package.
