# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

kqemu: The QEMU Accelerator (KQEMU) is a driver allowing a user application 
kqemu: to run x86 code in a Virtual Machine (VM). The code can be either 
kqemu: user or kernel code, in 64, 32 or 16 bit protected mode. KQEMU is 
kqemu: very similar in essence to the VM86 Linux syscall call, but it adds 
kqemu: some new concepts to improve memory handling.
