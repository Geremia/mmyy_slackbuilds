kqemu: The kermel module for qemu
 
The QEMU Accelerator (KQEMU) is a driver allowing a user application to 
run x86 code in a Virtual Machine (VM). The code can be either user or
kernel code, in 64, 32 or 16 bit protected mode. KQEMU is very similar
in essence to the VM86 Linux syscall call, but it adds some new concepts
to improve memory handling.

NOTE: This is not needed (or used) by qemu-0.12.x or later.
