gPodder is a podcast receiver/catcher written in Python utilizing PyGTK for
its user interface.  gPodder allows the user to subscribe to RSS feeds for
podcasts, videocasts, and other similar content and download media files
found in those feeds.  gPodder has system-tray notifications, remote access 
to the gpodder.net web services and optional support for Bluetooth and iPod 
synchronization.

This script packages the stable version from the 3.x branch.

This is incompatible with gpodder (install only one of the two).
