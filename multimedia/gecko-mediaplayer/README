Gecko Mediaplayer is the modern replacement for the mplayerplug-in
application.

It is a browser plugin that uses GNOME MPlayer to play media in a browser.
It should work with most browsers (not Chrome) on Unix-ish systems
(Linux, BSD, Solaris) and uses the NS4 API (Mozilla, Firefox, Opera, etc.).

If you plan on using this plugin for Apple QuickTime Trailers and you do not
want the plugin to wait until the cache is full before playing, then run this
script with:
     FULLCACHE=NO

Waiting for the cache to fill is thought to be more reliable;  YMMV.
