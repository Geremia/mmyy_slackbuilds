Please, also note that many of my scripts are designed to install unstable
development versions of the software packages, and may require
corrections at any time when a source code is significantly modified
by its developers.
Prior to opt for my scripts, I would suggest to check: 
* the official Slackware packages http://www.slackware.com/changelog/
* SlackBuild.org http://slackbuilds.org 
* Eric Hameleers' (AlienBOB) http://www.slackware.com/~alien/slackbuilds/ , 
* PhantomX/slackbuilds http://phantomx.github.io/slackbuilds/
* Slackers/slackbuilds https://github.com/conraid/SlackBuilds
* Papitux/SlackStuff https://github.com/Papitux/SlackStuff


for the more stable and perhaps better tested versions.
My SlackBuild scripts are complementary to those.

All my scripts are tested to be working on my own Slackware 
configuration, based on: 
* the Slackware-current for the x86_64 architecture 
* Eric Hameleers' (AlienBOB) 'multilib'&'ktown_testing' (for the Frameworks 5)
* Ponce/SBo-git (current) https://github.com/Ponce/slackbuilds
* and the revised versions of SlackBuilds from the mentioned above

SBo-git - slackbuilds repository for slackware-current

this is an unofficial fork of master branch from slackbuilds.org's
git repository (http://slackbuilds.org/cgit/slackbuilds/).

here I put my unofficial mods to their slackbuilds to run on
slackware-current with sbopkg (http://www.sbopkg.org).

Check https://github.com/Ponce/slackbuilds/wiki for additional informations.

See https://github.com/Ponce/slackbuilds/wiki/configuring-the-current-repository-with-sbopkg
for instructions on how to use this repository with sbopkg.
