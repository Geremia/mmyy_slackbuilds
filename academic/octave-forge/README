This is a script to package Octave-Forge, the main source for
out-of-mainline Octave packages.

The Octave-Forge packages are grouped into four categories (main,
extra, language and nonfree). By default the script packages all of
them, but you can specify a different behavior with the REPOS
variable. For example,
  REPOS=main,extra ./octave-forge.SlackBuild
will build only the "main" and "extra" repositories.
Parallel compilation is not supported.

Some packages have dependencies on external components that are not
available on stock Slackware or SlackBuilds.org. These components
(and, more generally, packages failing compilation) are automatically
excluded from the package.

If you want to build a newer version of Octave-Forge, you need to
regenerate the Octave script that performs the build itself. To do
this, run generate-installscript.sh after updating the usual variables
near the beginning.

Note: on package removal, you should run as root:
  mkdir -p /usr/share/octave/packages && \
  octave --silent --eval "pkg rebuild"
