Sage is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under 
the GPL. It combines the power of many existing open-source packages 
into a common Python-based interface. 
Mission: Creating a viable free open source alternative to Magma,
 Maple, Mathematica and Matlab. 

Sage can be used in several ways: through an interactive command line, 
by writing stand-alone scripts, through the graphical notebook 
interface in a browser, or through the KDE Cantor application (part
of a full Slackware installation).

Building sage requires >8GB of disk space, so you may need to
redefine $TMP and/or $OUTPUT.

See README.BUILDOPTS for additional (important) information about
build options and such.

NOTE:
Future SAGE (7.3+) requires some changes in Slackware's core packages:
- readline must be linked to ncurses
  Get readline's SlackBuild script, change this line
  make $NUMJOBS static shared || make static shared  || exit 1
  into
  make $NUMJOBS static shared SHLIB_LIBS=-lncurses || make static
  shared SHLIB_LIBS=-lncurses || exit 1
  and rebuilt readline.
- Python rebuilt against UCS-4 (enabled by default in next Slackware)
