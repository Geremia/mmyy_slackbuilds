An emulator for the Z80 series of Texas Instruments graphing 
calculators. It emulates all current Z80 calculator models 
except the TI-81, and features a debugger, external file 
loading, and full flash support, including flash app loading. 

Tilem requires no additional dependencies other than GTK, but
does require a rom from one of the supported calculators to
function.
